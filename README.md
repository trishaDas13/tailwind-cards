lang="en": This attribute specifies the language of the web page, set to English ("en").

class="bg-black flex justify-center items-center h-screen": These classes are applied to the body tag. They set the background color to black (bg-black) and use Flexbox to horizontally and vertically center the content (flex justify-center items-center). The h-screen class makes the body take up the full height of the viewport.

class="w-[53%] h-[66%] bg-[rgb(108,108,108)] relative flex justify-between items-center px-12": These classes are applied to one of the div elements within the body. They set the width and height of the div to 53% and 66% of its parent container, respectively. The background color is a shade of gray defined using RGB values (bg-[rgb(108,108,108)]). The relative class indicates that the element should be positioned relative to its normal position. The remaining classes are used to center the content both horizontally and vertically and add padding.

class="h-[100px] w-[100px] ml-[1.5rem]": These classes are applied to and img tag and define its height, width, and left margin.

class="text-[16px] text-gray-50 font-bold w-[80%] leading-[18px]": These classes style an h1 element. They set the text size, color, font weight, width, and line height.

class="bg-[rgb(30,144,255)] rounded-[20px] text-[8px] font-bold text-gray-50 px-10 py-[0.4rem] mt-[1.5rem]": These classes style a button. They set the background color, border radius, text size, font weight, text color, padding, and margin-top.

class="text-[8px] text-gray-400 text-center mt-[0.5rem]": These classes style a paragraph. They set the text size, color, alignment, and margin-top.

Similar class descriptions apply to the other HTML elements within the code, specifying their styling and positioning properties.

It's important to note that these classes are likely defined in a Tailwind CSS stylesheet, and the [...] syntax is often used in Tailwind CSS to specify dynamic or custom values based on configuration. For example, w-[53%] might be interpreted as "width: 53%" by Tailwind CSS.
